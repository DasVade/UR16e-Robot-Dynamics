The implementation includes:
- Kinematic modeling based on Denavit–Hartenberg parameters  
- Symbolic dynamics derivation using the Euler–Lagrange formulation  
- Simulation of joint motion, torque profiles, and end-effector trajectories  
- Visualization and plotting of dynamic responses  

Developed primarily in **MATLAB**, with numerical solvers and plotting utilities for analysis.
